    <h2 class="headtext">Regular coffee drinking linked to lower blood pressure</h2>
    <p class="headtext2">Cicero and his team wanted to investigate just how the interaction between caffeine and other compounds found in coffee
    would influence the incidence of blood pressure.
    To conduct their study, Cicero’s team examined a sample including 720 men and 783 women who were participants in the
    Brisighella Heart Study.
    This ongoing study, which first began in 1972, includes a randomized sample representative of a rural Northern Italy
    town called Brisighella.
    The researchers looked at participants’ blood pressure and coffee-drinking habits, as well as a selection of other data
    relevant to cardiovascular health.
    Upon analysis of the data, they found that coffee consumption was associated with lower blood pressure.
    “The trend seems to be positive from 2 [cups of] coffee per day,” said Cicero. “So, coffee drinking should not be a
    priori forbidden in current coffee drinkers, if the fear is that coffee could increase BP levels.”</p>
    <h2 class="headtext">Should people with high blood pressure drink coffee?</h2>
    <p class="headtext2">Megan K. Rhoads, PhD and postdoctoral scholar, Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology at The University of
    Alabama at Birmingham, said there are a few mechanisms through which coffee consumption could lower blood pressure, some
    of which have been demonstrated in animal studies.
    “Coffee contains caffeine, which can both raise and lower blood pressure in acute settings, but it also contains
    antioxidants and bioactive compounds which may be responsible for the blood pressure lowering effect,” she explained.
    Rhoads offered chlorogenic acid as an example of a compound that can lower systolic blood pressure in rats.</p>
